A feeble attempt to solve a Fredholm integral equation of the 2nd kind using
the GNU GSL. Also my first foray into C in a looooong time. Expect lots of
breakage!

To test the solver, I choose ab initio the kernel K(x,x'), the 'unknown
function' f(x), and the integration limits (a,b). I use these to solve
for the auxiliary function g(x). Then I go back and pretend I don't know
f(x), but I DO know g(x). Then I know what answer the solver should
produce for f(x) and can compare.

The first case has the following conditions:

K(x,x') = K(x) = 3x
g(x) = -34x - 1
(a,b) = (0,4)

The answer (you can check this by hand) is f(x) = 2x - 1.
