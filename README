| DESCRIPTION |
\-------------/

This routine solves integral equations (both Fredholm and Volterra, and of both
the 1st and 2nd kind) using the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

| DEPENDENCIES |
\--------------/

CMake: http://cmake.org/
GNU Scientific Library (GSL): http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/

/--------------------\
| BUILD INSTRUCTIONS |
\--------------------/

1.) First, set the environment variable GSL_DIR to point to the root directory
of your GSL installation, e.g., /usr/local or $HOME/gsl:

export GSL_DIR=/path/to/gsl

2.) Then create a new directory in which to build the source:

cd /path/to/gsl_integral/solver
mkdir build
cd build

3.) Then run CMake:

cmake ..

The resulting binary should be in
/path/to/gsl_integral_solver/build/src/gsl_integral_solver

| OTHER NOTES |
\-------------/

To test the solver, I choose ab initio the kernel K(x,x'), the "unknown
function" f(x), and the integration limits (a,b). I use these to solve for the
auxiliary function g(x). Then I go back and pretend I don't know f(x), but I DO
know g(x). Then I know what answer the solver should produce for f(x) and can
compare.

The first case has the following conditions:

K(x,x') = K(x) = 3x
g(x) = -34x - 1
(a,b) = (0,4)

The answer (you can check this by hand) is f(x) = 2x - 1.
